# basic-flight-card
A basic flight card demo for arduino or etc. Written in C++ on Arduino IDE. I share it because it can be improved

It just throttle up or down the 4 DC motor who are controlled by L298N motor driver according it's accelometer values.

And it can transfer accelometer datas via Wi-Fi with an esp module or bluetooth
